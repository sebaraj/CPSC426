// like a database, web service, or file system. Fetching could take
// considerable time.

// Fetch() should be called multiple times to keep fetching new data.
// Fetching is considered done once `false` is returned.

// You do not need to implement `Fetcher` in any way, just use the
// `Fetch()` method as part of `MergeFetches`.

	//  - new data and `true` when there is data available to be fetched
	//  - "" and `false` when fetching is done

	//

	// ```
	// for {
	//     data, ok := fetcher.Fetch()
	//     if !ok {
	//         break

// MergeFetches is similar to `MergeChannels`, however you must merge results
// returned from a "Fetcher" instead of a channel. Consider Fetcher like an
// interface for fetching data from a database or web service. It may take
// significant amount of time.
//
// MergeFetches must fetch from both `a` and `b` concurrently and write results
// to `out` until both fetchers are "done" (have returned `false` from `Fetch()`).
// Once complete, `out` must be closed.
//
// We recommend using `sync.WaitGroup` and goroutines to implement `MergeFetches`.

//   - https://pkg.go.dev/sync#example-WaitGroup
