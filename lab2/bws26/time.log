I discussed my solution with: ChatGPT (k8s syntax/base64 decoding questions) 

DISCUSSION: 

This problem set was very straight forward, as I have experience
working with docker and k8s in previous projects. However, those projects were
done under no supervision, so learning about multi-stage builds (and their
subsuqeuent reduction in image size) was fascinating, and I took the
most time proportional to the lines required. I also found it annoying to
always have to change the deployment yaml in order to successfully re-run
`kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`, but at the end of the project, I learned of
a new command to rollout the new changes without needing to change my yaml
files, `kubectl rollout restart deploy/video-rec-service`. (I know, I'm dumb)
